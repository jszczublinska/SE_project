## Sprint Retrospective

### Our observations

- maintaining specific tasks in form of sprint backlog was motivating
- active and working group, what needs to be done is done
- sometimes tasks were even too specific, which resulted in many dependencies between them
- we lacked group discussions about transferring the abstraction into code

### Start doing
- select timeslots/dates to work to ensure that there is always someone to consult our work with (everyone has their task but are available to discussions)

### Continue doing
 - completing the tasks
 - team communication
 - maintain sprint backlog
